# CORIO
CORIO (Pronounced as KOR-IO) is an open source tool to exercise longevity test and to check IO stability.
This is a protocol agnostic tool hence any other IO protocol can be plugged in and exercised as and when needed.
This Tool can be divided logically in following sections:

    Workload
    Core Library
    Configurations
    Scripts
    Utils

## WHY CORIO

Needed a single aggregator / umbrella tool which does following:
-   Checks Sustainability of IO Operations for long duration and updates results based on expected execution runtime
-   Support Stress (exponential workload) as well as longevity testing.
-   Supports S3 IO operations using full capability of boto APIs.
-   Benefits from unique capabilities of multiple IO tools (S3bench, WARP, etc.
-   Supports failure mode testing over long runs.
-   Supports plug-n-play for other protocols (NFS, SMB, Block-IO, etc).
-   Supports easy deployment and enables various usage scenario across teams.

## CURRENT CAPABILITIES

- Matrix Based Test Execution:
  -   Parallel test execution from multiple test suites, 
  -   for e.g. first test from each suite will start and will be marked pass once it achieves ETA duration of execution.
  -   Then next set of tests will start and previously “pass” marked tests will also continue to run for background load generation.

- Seed based execution for easy reproduction of failure scenarios.
- Customized for CORTX requirements:
  -   Automated execution using Jenkins framework.
  -   Results update in Jira.
  -   Periodic system health checks.
  -   Resource monitoring (CPU, Memory, etc.).
  -   Capture support bundle logs (periodic and on failure).

## Start Here

**Note:** CORIO is an under development project, use with caution and report issues.

Kindly brush up Git knowledge if you are new to GitHub,
Follow the [github process readme](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/github-process-readme.md)
to configure git on your local machine. Create a GitHub account and get access to Seagate Repositories.
You may need a separate client with any Linux Flavour to install client side pre-requisites and start using CORIO.

### Get the Sources

Fork local repository from Seagate's [CORIO](https://github.com/Seagate/corio.git). Clone CORIO repository from your local/forked repository.

    git clone https://github.com/Seagate/corio.git
    cd corio/
    git status
    git branch
    git checkout dev
    git remote -v
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Seagate/corio.git
    git remote -v
    Issuing the above command again will return you output as shown below.
    > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/corio.git (fetch)
    > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/corio.git (push)
    > upstream        https://github.com/Seagate/corio.git (fetch)
    > upstream        https://github.com/Seagate/corio.git (push)
    # Create new branch and push changes to it.
    git checkout -b <branch>
    git commit -s -m "message" <file>
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream --rebase dev # Resolve if any conflict and continue rebase.
    git push origin <branch>

### Environment Setup

    Following steps help to set up env, where CORIO runs. These steps assume that you have installed git client and cloned the repo.

    1. Python 3.7 Version should be installed and configured in client system.
    2. Run following commands to update yum repo and pip.
         - `yum update -y`
         - `pip install --upgrade pip`
    3. Change dir to corio project directory, make sure a requirement file is present in project dir.
    4. Create Virtual environment `python3.7 -m venv virenv`
    5. Activate Virtual environment `source virenv/bin/activate`
    6. Use following command to install python packages.
            `pip install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt`

### Prerequisites

-   S3 account and access key and secret key should be present to carry out execution

-   Test input may be either a single yaml file path or a directory path containing multiple tests data input yaml files, which will be executed in parallel

    -   file path i.e. workload/s3/s3api/bucket_operations.yaml
    -   directory path i.e. workload/s3/s3api or any other customized directory(i.e. workload/s3/io)
    -   refer [yaml structure](docs/YAML_documents/yaml_structure.md) and [sample file](docs/YAML_documents/sample_file.yaml) to create workload

### CORIO help options

  Use following command to execute workloads from different scenarios in parallel.

    python corio.py -ak <access_key> -sk <secret_key> -ep <s3.seagate.com> -ti <workload_directory_path>


#### Usage

    corio.py [-h HELP][-ti TEST_INPUT] [-v, --verbose] [-us USE_SSL] [-sd SEED]
    [-sk SECRET_KEY] [-ak ACCESS_KEY] [-ep ENDPOINT] [-nn NUMBER_OF_NODES]

#### Arguments

      -h, --help    
                show this help message and exit
